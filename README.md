# BlackJack
Blackjack (known as twenty-one in some locations) is a popular card game based on trying to get the closest to 21 without going over with the person closest winning; the version you are building consists of only twoplayers though (the user and the dealer).

This is a simple command line application based on a 2 player version ofthe game blackjack.  This application is structured using the model-view-controller paradigm and scomes with a set of unit tests to verify that parts of the application work as expected.
